                this game has costumes! Just like Mario Party 2! It's probably just as good.

                  It's difficult to see Duck Dodgers for what it really is.

                  It was pure chaos. The very act of playing Duck Dodgers is artistic.

                Sp0ck1 rented this once. He said it was an interesting game where you got to fly around as 
                a bee, but it had a very off-putting vibe to it. Once saw this game at a random kid's house 
                and played it. Enjoyed being the bee. <br><br>N64Mania played it in its infancy, and riocoys played it
                as an early N64Maniac. He's been demanding a runback ever since.

                    <p>Civilization is how I met a lot of the people I'm close to today. 
                    It's an extremely important game to me. When I first shared it on 
                    stream and asked people to play with me, I was so pleased to see
                    people turn up to play and also to watch, and I'm so glad that it
                    counts as a community event for the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sp0ck1">Sp0ck1 Stream</a>
                    now. Civ VI is an absolutely beautiful game, too. </p>

                  <p>Here are some facts about golf: <br><br>
                  Golf is a sport.
                  Golf is known to have been played in Scotland as early as 486 B.C.E. 
                  Prehistoric Scottish golfers were known as Scruggers, named for the divots 
                  they often left in the ground when they swung at the ball with blunt instruments.
                  Their word for divot was "scrug".

                  Playing Jackbox games with friends is one of the best ways I can think of 
                  to spend any Saturday night. Literally every time it happens, it feels like a gift. 
                  Jackbox games are the only games I am willing to pre-order, because they are just that good.
                  We'll play each game on release night, then come back for a full evening on that Saturday.
